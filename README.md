# employee-manager

## Description

This application is designed to provide employers with an easy way to view, edit, add, and remove data about their employees. There are three tables: employee, role, and department to help compartmentalize the various types of data needed by the user. The user changes the data in a MySQL database by following prompts on the command line, and refreshes their MySQL tables to see the data change.

## Installation

After pulling the repository, install dependencies after running 'npm i' in your console and confirm that MySQL database has the correct seed data and is ready for use. Finally, type 'npm start' in the console to begin the application. 

## Usage

The user is presented with choices about which data to view. From there, tables appear in the console that reflect the chosen tables. More specific options are given afterward, such as updating an employee, adding a department, deleting a role, etc. Once the requests are made, the user can navigate to the mySQL database tables and press the lightning bolt icon to watch their changes happen.
